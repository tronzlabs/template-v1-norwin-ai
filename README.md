## Notes

- Mock media is served from Unsplash + open video clips; no uploads required.
- Authentication and generation are mocked (client-side) to showcase UX flows.
- Animations follow the spec: subtle page fades, staggered cards, smooth tab swaps
  using `layoutId`, skeleton shimmer during generation, and floating hero badges.
